For this lab you are charged with reproducing and critically evaluating a 
statistical report. Your group is expected to do the following:  


__1. Reproduce the statistical procedure included in the report.__ 

* What did you have to modify to reproduce the statistical procedure used?  

</br>

\color{blue}
The code to read in the data file is a full-path to where the data were stored 
on my (Allison's) computer. You need to change this to be the path *relative* to
where the data are stored in the RStudio project.  

The path should look like:
\color{black}

```{r, eval = FALSE}
stat216 <- read.csv("data/stat216_spring2015.csv")
```

\color{blue}
Once the path has been modified, the t-test executes and you should obtain the 
same test statistic and p-value as the report.

* Was anything unclear to you when attempting to reproduce the statistical 
procedure? If so, what was unclear?    

\color{blue}
In the Introduction the report states that "we wish to study if the TEAL 
curriculum provides an overall better outcome for studentâ€™s grades in STAT 216."
However, the hypotheses provided and the t-test performed are for a two-sided 
test for a difference in means. Thus, the either the code would need to be 
modified to perform a one-sided t-test or the Introduction would need to be 
revised to state that they wish to study if there is a difference in the 
curricula.

__2. Change the statistical procedure used in the report as needed.__ 
<!-- Remove the procedures from the original report and insert your revisions. -->

* What modifications to the statistical procedure needed made? Why?  

</br>

\color{blue}
The assumptions of a t-test are:  

* independence
* equal variance of the groups
* normally distributed responses (population distributions are normally distributed) 

It does not seem likely that the assumption of independence is violated, as we
are considering data from only one semester and a student can only enroll in one 
Stat 216 course each semester. 

It also seems that the two curricula have similarly spread distributions, both
ranging in GPA grades from 0.0 to 4.0. However, the distribution of the grades 
for both curricula **do not** appear to come from a Normal distribution. Thus, 
the assumption of normally distributed responses is violated and a t-test is 
not an appropriate statistical procedure.  

Instead, a permutation test should be conducted. This test assumes that the 
distributions of each group are similar. As seen in the violin plots, it does 
not appear that the shapes of the distributions differ substantially.

__3. Read the report and for each section create a pro/con list of what was good and what needs improvements.__  
Include **at least** three pros and three cons for each section! 

\color{blue}
A compilation of my responses and your responses are included in each pro/con, 
in italics.

__Introduction__   

__PRO:__ 

- One: *Nice description of background information, situating the context of the study.* 
- Two: *Articulates how curricula differ from each other.* 
- Three: *Stated research question*    

__CON:__ 

- One: *Description of curricula (TEAL & traditional) don't match names of 
curricula in the data (MSU.0 & Lock).*
- Two: *The research question stated does not match the hypotheses stated and 
the t-test carried out.*
- Three: *Doesn't describe how the students were placed in either classroom 
(Did they choose? Was it random?)* 


__Data Collection__   

__PRO:__ 

- One: *Thoroughly outlined how students' grades were calculated*
- Two: *Bullet points lays out the variables in an easy to read form.*
- Three: *Lists all questions asked of students* 

__CON:__ 

- One: *Cite previous research done that supports better learning in TEAL classrooms.* 
- Two: *It does not explain how data was collected or sample size, etc.*
- Three: *Possibly too much information on the data collected, especially the 
data that are not being used to address the research question.*


__Methods__ 

__PRO:__ 

- One: *Nice to have plots in the section where the distribution of the data is being discussed.*  
- Two: *Used plots to asses assumptions and included them in report so reader can see them visually also.* 
- Three: *Statistical analysis used is directly stated, alongside the response and explanatory variables*

__CON:__ 

- One: *Doesn't address the assumption of normality at all!* 
- Two: *The x-axis label could be more descriptive.* 
- Three: *Labels on the plot should agree with the names of the curriculum being discussed.*


__Hypothesis__  
<!-- This section only needs at least 2 points.  -->

__PRO:__ 

- One: *Nice layout with the math equations!* 
- Two: *Uses common notation for differences in means*

__CON:__ 

- One: *Does not explicitly state the null hypothesis.*
- Two: *Alternative hypothesis does not agree with previously stated research question.*


__Results__  

__PRO:__ 

- One: *References p-value alongside the test statistic obtained.*
- Two: *Uses language of "evidence against" as opposed to rejecting the null for some arbitrary $\alpha$ level.* 
- Three: *They provide interpretations of the test in the context of the problem, rather than simply stating 'there is evidence against the null.'*

__CON:__ 

- One: *A p-value is never truly 0. It should be reported to be < 0.0001 if it is very small.*
- Two: *A small p-value provides **evidence against** the null hypothesis, not **evidence for** the alternative hypothesis.* 
- Three: *Conclusion is for a one-sided test, when a two-sided t-test was performed.*  


__Scope of Inference__ 

__PRO:__ 

- One: *Correctly states the population of interest.* 
- Two: *Correctly states that we cannot make cause-and-effect statements.* 
- Three: *Correctly states that we cannot infer to a larger population because students were not randomly sampled.*

__CON:__ 

- One: *Doesn't state how the students were assigned to courses, just that it was non-random.*
- Two: *Doesn't state that we can say that curriculum is **associated** with a difference in grade.* 
- Three: *Never states results in the context of this scope of inference.*


__Overall Report Format__  
<!-- This section only needs at least 2 points.  -->

__PRO:__ 

- One: *Report is in good coherent order, and uses good grammar.* 
- Two: *Having section headings makes the report feel well organized.*

__CON:__ 

- One: *All code used in the report should have been included in the appendix.*
- Two: *Code output is included in the report and should not be. It makes reading the results difficult.*
- Three: *The report has spelling errors!*
